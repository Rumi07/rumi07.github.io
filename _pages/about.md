I am currently pursuing my PhD in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Kentucky.  
I am working as a Graduate Teaching Assistant in the Department of Computer Science and as a Graduate Research Assistant in the Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Biomedical Informatics.

My research focuses on developing advanced data mining and computer vision algorithms to solve problems in medical and biological informatics. I am passionate about integrating spatial transcriptomics, single-cell RNA-seq, and multi-omics datasets into **causality-aware multimodal models** for tasks like imputation and prediction.

Alongside research, I actively contribute to the academic community through teaching, mentoring, and collaborating on interdisciplinary projects.  I was one of the [Campion of Huwaei seeds for the future 2020](https://www.newagebd.net/article/115387/10-bangladeshi-students-to-receive-training-from-huawei-hq#google_vignette). I was able to get the opportunity to have training about  fundamentals of 5G technology, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, Cloud Computing, IOT devices, Cyber Security and Leadership.
I am enthusiastic about applying machine learning and artificial intelligence to improve healthcare and biological data analysis.

Feel free to explore my publications, projects, and blog posts to learn more about my journey!
